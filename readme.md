# ZigCord Features
-  Connect with intents
-  Consume and parsing events from discord
-  Send HTTP messages back to discord

# What ZigCord does not do (yet)
-  Handle reconnects
-  Give you helper functions for sending events (e.g. messages) to discord

Recursively clone, place your token inside a file called `.token`, and run `zig build run` for the reading-events example.
